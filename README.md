Very simple example project using webpack and sbolgraph

To use, first install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) which comes with `npm`. Then:

    npm install
    npm start

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` (it might take a minute while webpack compiles everything)

For distribution:

    npm run-script build

Then upload everything from `dist/` to your webserver.
